Real-Time Sales Dashboard with Streamlit
This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a live, real-time sales dashboard using Python, Streamlit, and Pandas. The application simulates live sales events and visualizes key metrics as they happen, all within a simple, web-based interface. The entire application is self-contained and designed to be easily deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud directly from a GitHub repository.
